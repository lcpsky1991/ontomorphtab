/**
 * @$comment A wizard that allows a user to compose any arbitrary statement involving
 * semantic entities and properties.  Allows users to select the subject of the
 * statement as any explicit or implicit entity known to the system, qualify that
 * subject, define a property relation to another explicity or implicit object,
 * and qualify that relation by conditions.  Takes advantage of knowing the
 * ontology type of the entities being selected at each stage to be the most
 * helpful in rendering question boxes.  Also allows for a reference to be associated
 * with the statement.
